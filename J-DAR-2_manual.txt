******************
* HOW TO INSTALL *
******************

1. Download the latest MUGEN from www.elecbyte.com

2. Install it to your harddrive

3. extract jdarii.zip into the mugen folder (MUGEN\)     *NEW!*

4. Run J'Dar'II by double clicking on the JDarII.exe
   

************************
* BUTTON CONFIGURATION *
************************

X         =  Shoot (hold X = charge beam)
left  + Y =  Sommersault to the left
right + Y =  Sommersault to the right
A         =  Smartbomb
B         =  Satelite-Dash (only if your ship ownz a satelite)


***********************************************************************
* I DONT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT MUGEN AND I JUST WANT TO CHECK THE SHOOTER *
***********************************************************************

okay, go to MUGEN\DATA\ and open mugen.cfg with your default text-editor.
There you can change video and sound settings as well as many other things.

For button configuration and speed-settings start the mugen.exe and go select
options from the menu. Here you can configure your sticks and pads (psx pads
are possible, too!). After you have altered the settings don't forget to
save them!

I recommend 'FAST1' as the default-speed setting!

After that, exit mugen.exe with the escape-button and start J'Dar'II via jdarii.exe

* HOW TO PLAY? *
****************

Shoot everything in sight and try to get past all four bosses ^_^


*****************
* SCORING GUIDE *
*****************

You start with a level 1 shot. Within time the shot-meter will rise
automaticly until it reaches level 3. Combine special capsules to
raise your shot-level up to level 5!

The score you get for one hit depends on the shot-level:

Level#1  =  75 pts.
Level#2  = 150 pts.
Level#3  = 225 pts.
Level#4  = 300 pts.
Level#5  = 375 pts.

Laser    =  75 pts.
Shield   =  75 pts.
Beam     = 150 pts.


*******************
* CAPSULE SYSTEM: *
*******************

J-Dar-II has a unique powerup system: the capsule system.
You can collect various capsules during the game, simply
by moving over them. Try to combine them to get various
weapons or special items, like laser, shield or a speed up.

HINT: By using your Beamshot, you can transform enemies into capsules!

Capsule-Combinations:

123 = Bigger Projectile
231 = Bigger Projectile
312 = Bigger Projectile
321 = Bigger Projectile
132 = Bigger Projectile
213 = Bigger Projectile
