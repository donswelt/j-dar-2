J-Dar-II has a unique powerup system: the capsule system.
You can collect various capsules during the game, simply
by moving over them. Try to combine them to get various
weapons or special items, like laser, shield or a speed up.

HINT: By using your Beamshot, you can transform enemies into capsules!
